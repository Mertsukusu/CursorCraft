# Code Style Guidelines - ${PROJECT_NAME}

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for the ${PROJECT_NAME} project built with ${PROJECT_FRAMEWORK}.

## General Principles

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use consistent naming and formatting
- Write self-documenting code with descriptive names
- Add comments for complex logic only

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict type checking with `strict: true` in tsconfig
- Avoid using `any` type whenever possible
- Use interface for object shapes that will be used across the codebase
- Use type for simpler, single-use object types
- Use proper type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Use type inference where it makes code cleaner and type is obvious

## Folder Structure

- Use the standard Next.js App Router structure
- Keep related files together within feature-based directories
- Place reusable UI components in `components/`
- Place utility functions and services in `lib/`
- Organize styles in `styles/`
- Keep documentation in `docs/`

## Component Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use descriptive, noun-based names for components
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and instances

### Component Structure

- Use functional components with hooks
- Put each component in its own file
- Export components as named exports
- For complex components, separate logic, state management, and UI
- Use JSDoc comments for component documentation

### Props

- Define prop interfaces at the top of the file
- Use destructuring for props
- Provide default values for optional props

## CSS Guidelines

- Follow a consistent naming convention for CSS classes
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes primarily
- Prefer composition over complex styling
- Use CSS variables for theming and customization

## State Management

- Use Zustand for global state management
- Keep state logic separate from UI components
- Use local state (useState) for component-specific state
- Use reducers for complex state logic

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write component tests for UI components
- Test edge cases and error states
- Use mock data for tests

## Git Practices

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Create feature branches for new features
- Use pull requests for code reviews

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### ${PROJECT_FRAMEWORK} Best Practices

- Follow the official documentation for ${PROJECT_FRAMEWORK}
- Use built-in features and optimizations provided by the framework
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- Follow the framework's recommended patterns for data fetching and state management

## ESLint and Prettier Configuration

- Use ESLint for static code analysis
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Enforce consistent code style across the project
- Fix linting errors before committing
