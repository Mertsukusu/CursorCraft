# Hero Image Instructions

To complete the homepage with an image, you should:

1. Create a file named `hero-image.jpg` and save it in the `/public/images/` directory

## Recommended Hero Image Specifications:

- **Size**: 1600x900px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG or WebP (for better performance)
- **Content**: Something that represents development, coding, or productivity

## Quick Solution:

You can use a placeholder service temporarily:

1. Visit one of these services:

   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coding) and search for "coding" or "programming"
   - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/coding/) for free stock photos
   - [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) for a simple placeholder

2. Download or save the image to your computer

3. Rename it to `hero-image.jpg` and place it in the `/public/images/` folder

The image container uses `object-cover` which will crop the image to fit while maintaining its aspect ratio, so the exact dimensions aren't critical.
